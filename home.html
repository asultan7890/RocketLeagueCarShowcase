            <p><br>One of the amazing things about Rocket League is the near infinte possibilites there are while customizing your car. This website will showcase some of my favorite design and tips to make your car look amazing.</p>
            <p>Designing Tips</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Match Colors. Blue wheels and a blue boost will match nicely with a blue car.</li>
                <li>Light and Dark. A dark primary color used on a lightly colored decal adds emphasis to the decal. This makes it appealing and stands out more.</li>
                <li>Black Wheels. Black wheels match with any color, allowing you to make the car's color anything you want and it still looks good</li>
                <li>Anything. Do whatever you want to the car. The great thing about Rocket League is that there are so many options. You can customize your car however you like!</li>
